Voice-Controlled Robot Using Bluetooth and Arduino Uno

In my third semester of undergraduate Robotics Engineering, I embarked on an exciting project to develop a voice-controlled robot. This project marked my first foray into creating an autonomous robotic system. The primary objective was to control the robot using voice commands transmitted via a Bluetooth connection from an Android app.

Project Overview
Components Used:

Arduino Uno: The microcontroller at the heart of the robot, processing voice commands and controlling the robot's movements.
Bluetooth Module (HC-05): Facilitates wireless communication between the Arduino Uno and the Android app.
Motor Driver (L298N): Controls the DC motors responsible for the robot's movement.
DC Motors and Wheels: Provide locomotion to the robot.
Android App: Custom-built app to send voice commands to the Bluetooth module.

Functionality
The voice-controlled robot operates by receiving voice commands via the Bluetooth module, which are then processed by the Arduino Uno to perform specific actions. The Android app serves as the interface for issuing commands, enabling the user to control the robot's movement with simple voice inputs such as "forward," "backward," "left," and "right."

Key Features
Voice Command Recognition: The Android app interprets voice commands and sends corresponding signals to the Arduino via Bluetooth.
Wireless Control: The Bluetooth module allows for wireless control of the robot, enhancing its usability and flexibility.
Autonomous Attempt: This project also laid the groundwork for future autonomous functionality by incorporating basic obstacle avoidance sensors.

Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

Microcontroller Programming: Writing code for the Arduino Uno to interpret and execute voice commands.
Bluetooth Communication: Establishing and maintaining a Bluetooth connection between the robot and the Android app.
Mobile App Development: Developing a user-friendly Android app to serve as the control interface for the robot.
Robotics Systems Integration: Integrating various hardware components to create a functional and responsive robotic system.
This voice-controlled robot project not only strengthened my foundational knowledge in robotics and embedded systems but also sparked my interest in further exploring autonomous robotic technologies.
